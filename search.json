The Sales Department is very interested in this analysis, which will help them more easily penetrate various market segments.\nYou will be using stock prices in this analysis. You come up with a method to classify companies based on how their stocks trade using their daily stock returns (percentage movement from one day to the next). This analysis will help your organization determine which companies are related to each other (competitors and have similar attributes).\nYou can analyze the stock prices using what you’ve learned in the unsupervised learning tools including K-Means and UMAP.

The challenge here is to connect the dots between what we have and what we need to do to format it properly.\nWe know that in order to compare the data, it needs to be standardized or normalized. Why? Because we cannot compare values (stock prices) that are of completely different magnitudes. In order to standardize, we will convert from adjusted stock price (dollar value) to daily returns (percent change from previous day). Here is the formula.\n\\[\nreturn_{daily} = \\frac{price_{i}-price_{i-1}}{price_{i-1}}\n\\]\nFirst, what do we have?

    "text": "TASK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation Features\n\nWhat can you deduce about the interaction between Monthly Income and Attrition?\nThose that are leaving the company have a higher Monthly Income That those are staying have a lower Monthly Income ✔ Those that are leaving have a lower Monthly Income It’s difficult to deduce anything based on the visualization\nJustification: In the boxplot for Monthly Income, it is observed that employees who have left the company (Yes) have a lower monthly income range compared to those who have stayed (No). In addition, the density of monthly income for those who have left the company is higher at the lower income levels.\nQuestion 2 What can you deduce about the interaction between Percent Salary Hike and Attrition?\nThose that are leaving the company have a higher Percent Salary Hike Those that are staying have a lower Percent Salary Hike ** ✔Those that are leaving have lower Percent Salary Hike** It’s difficult to deduce anything based on the visualization\nIn the boxplot for Percent Salary Hike, it can be seen that employees who have left the company (Yes) have, on average, a lower percentage salary increase compared to those who have stayed (No).\nQuestion 3 What can you deduce about the interaction between Stock Option Level and Attrition?\nThose that are leaving the company have a higher stock option level Those that are staying have a higher stock option level ✔ It’s difficult to deduce anything based on the visualization\nThe box-and-whisker plot shows that employees who stay (No) have a distribution with higher levels of stock options compared to employees who leave (Yes), who tend to have lower levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nWhat can you deduce about the interaction between Environment Satisfaction and Attrition?\nA higher proportion of those leaving have a low environment satisfaction level ✔ A higher proportion of those leaving have a high environment satisfaction level It’s difficult to deduce anything based on the visualization\nLow levels of satisfaction with the environment (1 and 2) show a higher proportion of employees leaving the company compared to those with high levels of satisfaction (3 and 4). This can be seen in the distribution of the density curves, where the areas under the curves for “Yes” are larger at lower levels of satisfaction with the environment.\nQuestion 5 What can you deduce about the interaction between Work Life Balance and Attrition\n✔Those that are leaving have higher density of 2’s and 3’s Those that are staying have a higher density of 2’s and 3’s Those that are staying have a lower density of 2’s and 3’s It’s difficult to deduce anything based on the visualization\nJustification: In the graph, the density of those who leave the company (blue colour) is highest at values 2 and 3 for Work Life Balance. This indicates that people with these work-life balance values have a higher tendency to leave the company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7 What can you deduce about the interaction between Over Time and Attrition?\n✔ The proportion of those leaving that are working Over Time are high compared to those that are not leaving The proportion of those staying that are working Over Time are high compared to those that are not staying\nJustification: In the graph, it is observed that a higher proportion of employees working overtime are leaving the company (blue colour) compared to those who are not working overtime. This indicates that working overtime is associated with a higher attrition rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8 What can you deduce about the interaction between Training Times Last Year and Attrition\nPeople that leave tend to have more annual trainings ✔ People that leave tend to have less annual trainings It’s difficult to deduce anything based on the visualization\nJustification: In the graph, we observe that those who leave the company (blue colour) tend to have fewer trainings per year compared to those who stay (red colour). The density is higher at lower values of “Training Times Last Year” for leavers, indicating that a lower amount of training is associated with a higher attrition rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9 What can you deduce about the interaction between Years At Company and Attrition\nPeople that leave tend to have more working years at the company ✔ People that leave tend to have less working years at the company It’s difficult to deduce anything based on the visualization\nJustification: In the graph, we observe that the density of those who leave the company (blue colour) is higher in the first years of employment compared to those who stay (red colour). This indicates that people who have been with the company for fewer years tend to leave more than those who have been with the company longer.\nQuestion 10 What can you deduce about the interaction between Years Since Last Promotion and Attrition?\nThose that are leaving have more years since last promotion than those that are staying ✔ Those that are leaving have fewer years since last promotion than those that are staying It’s difficult to deduce anything based on the visualization\nJustification: In the graph, we can observe that the density of those who leave the company (blue colour) is higher in the first years since their last promotion compared to those who stay (red colour). This indicates that people who have spent less time since their last promotion tend to leave the company more than those who have spent more time since their last promotion."
